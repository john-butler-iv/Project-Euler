# Project-Euler
 This repository chronicles my Project Euler progress so far.
 I originally heard about Project Euler from my high school teacher, where we had to solve a few for class.

 Before I created this repo, I made ~80 of these individually, but now I'm refactoring to make future problems easier and for easier readability.
 I have made some fair efforts to optimize these problems, even if they already run rather quickly.

# Formats
 Problem files are all in one file titled P###.java and all extend the Problem abstract class
 Problems which can easily be parameterized extend ParapeterizedProblem
 EulerTools contains functions about simple properties of numbers
 PrimeFinder, as the name suggests finds primes and contains functions relating to primes, including factorizing
 Problems are times via the Problem Timers, grouped by 50's (1 page in the archives).
